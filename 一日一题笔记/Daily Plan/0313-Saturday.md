## What to do today

The weather is particularly good today ,and I'm going to my aunt's house tonight.

I had an argument with my girlfriend last night, and she really annoyed me. But when I saw the pictures I had taken of her before , I was a little soft-hearted. We are such couples . When we are in love ,we are "complementary in personality." When we do not like each other , we are "incompatible."

In fact ,she is so cute that I am willing to do anything for her ,  I can't help but not love her, I am lazy , but I'm super attentive when she needs me.

Even if I complain about her sometimes ,and sometimes I find her stupid , but I love her, it's an established fact.



I did nothing but play today ，I am so guilty, I will study hard tomorrow. 

I will get early , do not play mobile phone , study hard !

I wish I have a good spoken English , preferably a charming English speaking ，and I hope I can find a good job in July.
